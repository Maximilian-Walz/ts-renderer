# WebGPU Game Engine & Editor

A fun project to explore **rendering** and **computer graphics** concepts, as well as learn **TypeScript** and **WebGPU**.

### Key Components

- **Engine**: Core game engine powered by WebGPU for rendering and game logic.
- **Editor**: Real-time editor for building and testing game scenes, realized itself as a "game" using the engine.
- **Cool Game**: A simple game used to test and demonstrate engine features.
- **Game App**: A unified app to run either the **editor** or any game made with the engine.
